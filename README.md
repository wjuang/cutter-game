User Stories
As a player, I want to move intuitively and smoothly move across the ground and platforms so that I can attack and dodge in a satisfying manner.
I want to feel that the hitboxes are responsive and obvious.
I want to feel that my character doesn't stutter or slide across the page when I'm not inputting movement.
